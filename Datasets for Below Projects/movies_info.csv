An attraction which was physical initially but then got emotional and finally veered into complex territories resulting in a clash of ideologies and mindsets which drove them apart. Bitterly. Sriram believed that charity begins and ends at home. Whilst Dia felt that you have to be the change that you want to bring about.  However Sriram realizes that he is not over Dia and still loves her and that she is the best change that ever happened... and will happen to his life.

Frustrated and faced with the ultimate challenge, Sriram realizes the only way he can impress upon Dia to come back with him is by making Jhumli independent. By helping others... something he is just not accustomed to do. This is the biggest irony of his life. What he doesn't bargain for are the various road blocks he might face, in the face of politics, corruption and clueless villagers. But the biggest hurdle he faces eventually is himself. His own moral fabric which isn't up to the challenge he has undertaken. Will Sriram be able to win back his love? Will he be able to bring about the change in Jhumli as well as in himself???
